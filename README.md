## Clustering project (assignment 1)

The clustering project is the first assignment or mini project in the course. The work submitted is the preliminary submission featuring the first part being finished with the remaining part being to use the models on the customer_dataset.

## classification project (assignment 2)

the second assignment is the classification for the 2014 accidents dataset. data cleaning and encoding was done to the dataset then the output csv was used in the four different classifiers and here are the conclusions reahced

1. naive bayes is very simple to tune its hyperparameters and fast to train but it always predict the majority class
2. KNN mostly predicts the majority class as well and is more computationally expensive
3. neural networks and logistic regression were a bit better but they need more tuning and effort to be better with neural networks having more potential
4. all were tested with f1 score macro since accuracy was not a logical performance metric in our case
