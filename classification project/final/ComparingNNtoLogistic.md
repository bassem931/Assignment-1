# Classification
Comparing the NeuralNetwork classifier to LogisticRegression classifier:
1- Neural Network is faster in training, model selection and testing due to the fact that logistic regression may use polynomial hypothesis with high degrees.
2- Neural Network accuracy is slightly better than LogisticRegression due to the fact that Neural Network uses Backpropagation to minimize the cost function.
